Simplest text editor ever.

And I really mean that guys, my idea is to make it completely without buttons.

I got an idea when friend told me that he found VIM quite hard to understand.

I am just starting so right now we have only optin to save file or exit the editor.

I am going to keep adding new features as much as my time lets me.

Feel free to contribute in anyway just remember NO BUTTONS.
